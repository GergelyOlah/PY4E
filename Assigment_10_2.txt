10.2 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out the distribution by hour of the day for each of the messages. You can pull the hour out from the 'From ' line by finding the time and then splitting the string a second time using a colon.

Once you have accumulated the counts for each hour, print out the counts, sorted by hour as shown below.

Logic:

Create an empty list for the times

For loop through lines
If line starts with "From "
	Split it by whitespace
	Take the 5 word
	Split it by :
	Put it in a list

Creating a histogram  

Put it in order

Print it
