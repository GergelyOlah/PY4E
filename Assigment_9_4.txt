9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

Logic:

create an empty list
check if any of the lines starts with From with a Histogram
if yes: 
split it
take the second word add it to the list 
create a dic

for loop through the list
count the occurences of the emails in the list

check the greatest value in the distionarry
 
print it
